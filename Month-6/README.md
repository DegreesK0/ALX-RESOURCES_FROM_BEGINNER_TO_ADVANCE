# Materials for Month 6

Sprint 3 starts in Month 6 and it is the most hands on part of the Foundations training. For many it will be uncharted territory as there will be lots to learn and execute as quickly as possible. Lots of Linux-based tasks, software installation and configuration. Hopefully these materials will be useful to you and will help you get up to speed very quickly. This is not meant to be a replacement to the materials already provided on the intranet but to augument it and possibly cover areas that need more attention. If there are areas you need me to cover more, you can reach out to me.

## JavaScript
What is Node.js? Unlike other general purpose programming languages, Javascript was first developed as a special purpose language for web browsers. So it only ran in web browsers for a while. Node.js was then developed to be a runtime environment for Javascript which allows you to write and run Javascript outside a browser like other languages, in a termi example. Node.js provided the platform for Javascript to be used as a backend language and even write commandline scripts.

## SSH
What is SSH? SSH is a short form for Secure Shell, just as 'bash' is short for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is terminal-based program that allows you to give direct instructions as well as run precoded instructions written in a script. Simply put, it conveys your instructions to the kernel. More on that [here.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-terminal-console-shell-and-kernel/)

ssh enables you to securly execute commands and programs in a computer that is physically out of your reach. Your webserver is most likely in another country on another continent. SSH helps you connect to its terminal so you can run scripts, deploy programs and so on. Most of what you need to know about ssh is provided in the material of the task. There was however an issue where ssh keys were missing from sandbox terminals. [Follow this guide if you ever run into such an issue.](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/copy-ssh-keys)
