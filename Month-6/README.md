# Materials for Month 6

Sprint 3 starts in Month 6 and it is the most hands on part of the Foundations training. For many it will be uncharted territory as there will be lots to learn and execute as quickly as possible. Lots of Linux-based tasks, software installation and configuration. Hopefully these materials will be useful to you and will help you get up to speed very quickly. This is not meant to be a replacement to the materials already provided on the intranet but to augument it and possibly cover areas that need more attention.

Node.js provided the platform for Javascript to be used as a backend language and even write commandline scripts.
